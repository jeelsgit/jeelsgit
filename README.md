# Hi there, I'm Jeel! 👋

### 🌍 Geospatial Developer & AI Engineer
I am a software engineer who specializes in solving "where" problems. I bridge the gap between **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** and **Machine Learning**, building pipelines that transform raw spatial data into actionable insights.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as an **AI/ML Engineer at Xenara Inc.**
- 📍 Focus: **ArcGIS Pro Automation, Computer Vision, & Spatial SQL**
- 🎓 Alumni: **Algonquin College** (Computer Programming & Analysis)
